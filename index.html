                            A Certified Arborist is on staff for overseeing work, for consultations, and diagnosis of oak wilt and disease.Any size project whether tree pruning, tree removal or an entire office park, we can handle it in a timely manner!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            To properly manage a property, roof clearance pruning is very important. Not only do limbs on homes and other structures damage the siding and roof shingles, the limbs also provide a highway for insects and rodents to further damage the buildings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Another service that we offer is dead or hazardous tree removals. Our staff can properly evaluate the trees to see if they pose a risk of falling and are a liability to people and property.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Finally, we offer services to keep the trees healthy and maintained. For a make-ready for selling or move-in, we can remove dead wood and ball moss to get the trees healthy and looking great!

                            I just wanted to write a quick note and say a big "THANK YOU" to your excellent crew led by Rubicel! They did an outstanding job pruning our trees and the clean up was as great as the job they did! Your men were here on time and the truck with the branches, etc. was picked up within an hour of the crew's departure.
