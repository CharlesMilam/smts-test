            <p>
             I just wanted to write a quick note and say a big "THANK YOU" to your excellent crew led by Rubicel! They did an outstanding job pruning our trees and the clean up was as great as the job they did! Your men were here on time and the truck with the branches, etc. was picked up within an hour of the crew's departure.
